                            MSNT is committed to providing a safe workplace for its employees and subcontractors by mandating strict
                            adherence to the Company’s “ZERO TOLERANCE” accident prevention policy, applied through active employee participation
                            in training programs and daily application of Safety Program directives. Employees are encouraged to observe and monitor
                            work processes for deficiencies or areas of improvement and are recognized and compensated for their efforts through
                            the Company’s “GET HOME SAFE” Incentive Program. This innovative program is based on a proactive policy of NEAR-MISS
                            REPORTING & INVESTIGATION, designed to educate employees on how to recognize unsafe conditions and prevent accidents
                            in the workplace.

                            Given the nature of the industry and accompanying long work hours, personnel are subject to “training fatigue.” To
                            counter the effects of such fatigue and to keep employees on track, MSNT mandates a minimum
                            of (5) scheduled and unscheduled site audits per week, utilizing a BACK-TO-BASICS approach and checklist to remind
                            employees and subcontractor personnel that rigging safety must not be their only concern. These audits are conducted
                            by Company Safety Directors and Construction Managers, separate from and exclusive to daily Job Safety Analysis or
                            Job Hazard Analysis (JSA/JHA) meetings held each day before the start of work. Unscheduled site visits, employee
                            participation in development of safe work procedures and opportunities for recognition through safe actions are a
                            proactive and proven combination, leading to consistent application of Safety Program practices and procedures from
                            the classroom to the field.
